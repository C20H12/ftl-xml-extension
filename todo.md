## Going to implement
- add path complete for animations and other files
- format support
- allow marking events that are unused as not an error, still show a hint about the issue so it can be undone.
- add snippets for animations
- support reqs, checking and autocomplete
- error if blueprint is defined outside blueprint specific files [autoBlueprints, blueprints, dlcBlueprints and dlcBlueprintsOverwrite]


## Research required
- cache parsed state for workspace
- use FtlFile for document validation instead of dom
- implement or somehow use existing html query language
