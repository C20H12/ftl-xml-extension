## Going to implement
- check find refs works with multiple root folders. Checked, waiting on response
- add snippets for animations
- validate events will show up somewhere, basically it's referenced somewhere, either another event or from a sector beacon map
- add path complete for animations and other files
- add sound support
- format support
- support reqs, checking and autocomplete
- error if blueprint is defined outside blueprint specific files [autoBlueprints, blueprints, dlcBlueprints and dlcBlueprintsOverwrite]


## Research required
- cache parsed state for workspace
- use FtlFile for document validation instead of dom
- implement or somehow use existing html query language
